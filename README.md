Fertility issues are more common than many people think. In India, many couples wait for years thinking that pregnancy will just “happen someday.” While it’s good to stay positive, it's also important to know when to consult a fertility doctor early—because the sooner you find the reason, the better the chances of success.

Here are some early signs that a couple should see a fertility expert:

🔹 1. Trying for over 1 year without success (or 6 months if over 35):
This is the most basic rule. If a couple has unprotected sex for a year and pregnancy hasn’t happened, it’s time for a checkup. If the woman is above 35, don’t wait beyond 6 months. Fertility naturally declines with age.

🔹 2. Irregular or missed periods:
If the woman’s periods are too early, too late, or missing completely, it could mean ovulation is not happening. PCOS, thyroid, or stress could be the cause—but it needs checking.

🔹 3. Painful periods or intercourse:
Strong cramps during periods or pain during sex could be signs of endometriosis or fibroids, which may affect fertility.

🔹 4. Known issues like PCOS or thyroid problems:
If the woman has been diagnosed with PCOS, diabetes, or thyroid imbalance, it's good to see a fertility specialist even if you’re just starting to try.

🔹 5. Low sperm count or erection issues:
For men, signs like poor sexual performance, low sperm motility (in semen test), or past infections may signal male infertility. Don’t wait for years assuming it’s only the woman’s issue.

🔹 6. Multiple miscarriages:
If a couple has faced 2 or more miscarriages, that’s a sign something deeper may be wrong. It could be a genetic issue, hormone imbalance, or uterine shape problem.

🔹 7. Previous surgeries or infections:
Any history of surgery on the uterus, ovaries, or testicles—or infections like TB or PID—can affect fertility. Better to get evaluated early.

Sometimes, even when both partners seem healthy, they may still face “unexplained infertility.” That’s when all reports look okay, but pregnancy still doesn’t happen. In such cases, treatments like IUI or IVF help overcome hidden barriers.

The most important thing is: don’t delay. Fertility declines with age, and early action gives more treatment options and better chances of success.
